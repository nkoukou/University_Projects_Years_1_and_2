# Rutherford-Scattering

First year university project wihich models the interaction of alpha particles with gold atoms

Code files include:

* task_1.py (tests the np.odeint command with a body in simple harmonic motion)
* task_2,3.py (models a satellite trajectory around Mars)
* task_5.py (applies the understanding of the Mars model to a Rutherford scattering experiment simulation)
* rutherford.py (modifies task_5.py a bit so that it fits the first year project requirements for rutherford scattering modelling)
* thompson.py (modifies task_5.py a bit so that it fits the first year project requirements for thompson scattering modelling)
