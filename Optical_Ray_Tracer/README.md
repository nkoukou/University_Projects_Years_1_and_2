## Optical Ray Tracer

Second year university project which models the interaction of rays with simple optical elements (refractive and reflective surfaces).

The project consists of four modules:
* ray.py: contains a Ray class that produces the rays for the optical system.
* optical_elements: contains several classes that produce the optical elements of the system.
* nklab.py: contains all utility and the main plotting functions for the project.
* main.py: contains the four major analysis functions of the project.

In order to reproduce the graphs of the report, run the four functions of main.py
with default parameters.
